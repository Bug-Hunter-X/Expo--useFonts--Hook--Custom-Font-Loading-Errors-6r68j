This error occurs when using the Expo `useFonts` hook with a custom font that is not properly loaded or configured.  The symptoms include a blank screen, or fonts that don't render correctly. The error message itself may not be immediately obvious, and could manifest as another seemingly unrelated issue.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';
import AppLoading from 'expo-app-loading';

const App = () => {
  let [fontsLoaded] = useFonts({
    'my-custom-font': require('./assets/fonts/my-custom-font.ttf'),
  });

  if (!fontsLoaded) {
    return <AppLoading/>;
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text style={{ fontFamily: 'my-custom-font' }}>Custom Font Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

```

The issue might be caused by the font file itself (incorrect format, corrupted data), an incorrect file path, or issues with the font's metadata or licensing.
