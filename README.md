# Expo useFonts Custom Font Loading Issues

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose problem when using Expo's `useFonts` hook with custom fonts. The issue is that the hook might fail silently, leading to a blank screen or fonts not rendering as expected. This is often not accompanied by clear error messages, making debugging tricky.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows a typical implementation of `useFonts`. Despite appearing correct, it might fail due to problems with the font file itself (incorrect format, corruption, missing metadata), an incorrect file path, or other issues with font inclusion or licensing.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents several debugging and solution strategies:

1. **Verify Font File:** Ensure the font file is correctly formatted, not corrupted, and has all necessary metadata.
2. **Double-Check Path:** Carefully review the file path in `require('./assets/fonts/my-custom-font.ttf')` to ensure it's accurate.
3. **Font File Validation:** Use online tools or font checkers to validate the integrity and format of your font file.
4. **Font Licensing:** Ensure you have the correct license to use the font for your application.
5. **Expo Version and Dependencies:** Update Expo and related packages to their latest versions. 
6. **Caching Issues:** Try cleaning the cache and restarting the development server.
7. **Console Logging:** Add detailed console logs to track the `fontsLoaded` state and other variables related to font loading.
